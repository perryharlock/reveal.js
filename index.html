					<h1>Branch structures and workflow</h1>
					<p>A few ideas...</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Currently...</h2>
					<p>
						We create a single branch for all stories in the sprint from trunk.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>And then...</h2>
					<p>
						Once stories are complete in theory a code review will happen.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>And then...</h2>
					<p>
						Once reviewed and OK'd changes are pushed to trunk and deployed to test.
					</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h2>So what's wrong with that?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>We get to the point where 'ALL TEH THINGS' are being tested at once towards the end of the sprint.</li>
						<li>This can lead to a last minute rush to make amends.</li>
						<li>If one of the stories is incomplete we cannot deploy until it is finished.</li>
						<li>It is best to code review small chunks of work rather than a whole sprints worth.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Ok, what do you propose Charlie Big Potatoes?</h2>
					<p>The following proposal is based mainly from how other Agile / Scrum environments I have worked in operate.</p>
					<p>I've also talked to people in other organisations who work in a similar fashion to the way I am about to describe.</p>
					<p>IT'S NOT GOSPEL!</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Use Git for source control</h2>
					<p>This I supposes is a personal preference however I have found that Git is quicker than TFS for branching, committing, etc... (once you have the command line licked!)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Git</h2>
					<p>For example creating a new branch is as easy as typing:
						<pre style="text-align:center;"><strong>git checkout -b "new-branch-name"</strong></pre>from the branch you want to branch from.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>GitHub</h2>
					<p>I'd also love to use GitHub. Mainly for code reviews (but I understand there may well be a technical issue here)</p>
					<p>Creating a Pull Request which shows exactly what has changed for code reviewing is awesome!</p>
					<p>Code also does not slip under the radar until the PR has been OK'd by a reviewer.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Branching</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Creating a master branch for the sprint.</li>
						<li>Create a single branch for each story.</li>
						<li>As each story is completed it goes to code review.</li>
						<li>Once code reviewed it can be pushed to the master sprint branch which can in turn be pushed to TEST.</li>
						<li>The story branch is then deleted.</li>
						<li>Repeat for each story</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Hmmm....what are the benefits of this?</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Code can be deployed to TEST at any time for testing and feedback not just 2 days before the end of the sprint.</li>
						<li>If a story is not complete we can still deploy without it.</li>
						<li>We could deploy to LIVE more often if we want to release an individual story early.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Guidelines</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>No editing on trunk / master except for urgent bug fixes.</li>
						<li>Code does not get pushed to TEST until it has been code reviewed and OK'd.</li>
						<li>Incomplete / Broken code does not get pushed to TEST.</li>
						<li>Branch naming:
							<code><pre>#JIRATICKETNUMBER-name-of-story</pre></code>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
